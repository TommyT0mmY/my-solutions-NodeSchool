Almost every solution in this repository is not 100% efficient given the fact that I am learning Node.js through NodeSchool, feel free to correct my solutions, I would be very pleased to learn from my mistakes and understand how to improve my code.

I haven't uploaded every solution because I've encountered problems solving some problems, feel free to commit yours.
